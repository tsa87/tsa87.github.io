I am a PhD student in Computing Science at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/fas/computing.html), supervised by [Dr. Martin Ester](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ZYwC_CQAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on structure-based drug design with generative flow networks and flow matching models.

Currently, I am also a visiting researcher at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) and [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/ewsc), where I work on foundation models for bio-molecular generation and antibiotics discovery applications under the supervision of [Dr. Wengong Jin](https://wengong-jin.github.io/).

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Consultant at [Transcripta Bio](https://www.transcriptabio.com/), where I conducted experiments on generative models and large scale virtual screening. Before that, I interned at [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com/), developing the map of Biology and [Google](https://about.google/), working on AI models for search.

## Research Interests

My research is centered around AI for Drug Discovery, with a specific focus on:
- Foundation models for bio-molecular generation
- Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)
- Flow Matching and Diffusion Models
- Structure-based drug design
