## Work Experience

### Transcripta Bio <span style="float: right;">Palo Alto, CA</span>
**Machine Learning Consultant (Part-Time)** <span style="float: right;">Sep 2023 - Dec 2024</span>
- Leading experiments on generative models for molecules with desired gene expression, resulting in the discovery of several novel molecules with better predicted bioactivity profile.
- Enabling company's first ML-based virtual screening pipeline with compound library standardization, characterization and featurization - which resulted in several wet-lab validated hits.

### Recursion <span style="float: right;">Salt Lake City, UT</span>
**Software Engineer (Part-Time)** <span style="float: right;">Sep - Dec 2022</span>  
**Software Engineering Intern** <span style="float: right;">Jun - Sep 2022</span>
- Implemented gene search and enrichment analysis of biological pathways with **React** and Python using known biology databases to accelerate drug-target discovery workflow. Setup SLO alerts using **OpenTelemetry** and **Prometheus**.
- Built full-stack graph visualization and analysis app for millions of relationships between biological entities using **Dash**.

### Amgen <span style="float: right;">Burnaby, BC</span>
**Bioinformatics Co-op** <span style="float: right;">Jan - Apr 2022</span>
- Developed binding affinity prediction model of antibody and target protein on cell sorting data using **PyTorch** and ESM.
- Built Dash web app to visualize immune repertoire containing thousands of sequences through network graph.

### Google <span style="float: right;">Waterloo, ON</span>
**Software Developer Intern** <span style="float: right;">May - Aug 2021</span>
- Introduced contrastive learning to Retail AI ranking model and reduced average first click position by 0.36 using **TensorFlow**.
- Implemented adaptive multi-objective loss balancing algorithms (GradNorm, Uncertainty Weighting) to reduce over-fitting in multi-task ranking model.
- Used **C++** and **Flume (Apache Beam)** to build metric aggregation pipelines that processed terabytes of search logs to provide insights on search quality.

### Georgian <span style="float: right;">Toronto, ON</span>
**Machine Learning Engineering Intern** <span style="float: right;">Sep - Dec 2020</span>
- Built **ML Platform** command line tool that enables data scientists to seamlessly train hundreds of **docker**ized reproducible experiments on cloud in one command.
- Trained and evaluated models predicting startups' raise likelihood to help investment team on candidates prioritization.
- Generated novel features from large news dataset using **Apache Spark** and **increased AUPR by 10%** compared to baseline.
